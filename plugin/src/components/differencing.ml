(*
 * Returns true if the argument at the supplied index location of the 
 * inductive motive (which should be at relative index 1 before calling
 * this function) is an index to some application of the induction principle
 * in the second term that was not an index to any application of the induction
 * principle in the first term.
 *
 * In other words, this looks for applications of the motive
 * in the induction principle type, checks the argument at the location,
 * and determines whether they were equal. If they are ever not equal,
 * then the index is considered to be new. Since we are ornamenting,
 * we can assume that we maintain the same inductive structure, and so
 * we should encounter applications of the induction principle in both
 * terms in exactly the same order.
 *
 * The implementation of this uses an offset list to adjust as it goes.

(*
 * Assuming there is an indexing ornamental relationship between two 
 * eliminators, get the type and location of the new index.
 * This starts by identifying candidate new indices, then filters
 * them to the ones that are truly different.
 *
 * If indices depend on earlier types, the types may be dependent;
 * the client needs to shift by the appropriate offset.
 *
 * This algorithm only runs when there is ambiguity, since REDACTED's
 * algorithm can take care of simpler cases where the types enough
 * are revealing. There are some examples of ambiguity in Test.v;
 * these should never break, and if they do, it means the code is incorrect.
