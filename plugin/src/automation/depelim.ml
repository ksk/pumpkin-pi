(*
 * Given a relative context quantifying an inductive family's indices, assemble
 * the list of `constr` arguments to supply the inductive family's type former,
 * such that the argument for any index of sigma type is its eta-expansion.
 *
 * As an example, an `index_ctxt` of `[("x" : bool); ("y" : sigT vector)]`
 * becomes `[@1; existT vector (projT1 @2) (projT2 @2)]`, denoting each `Rel i`
 * as `@i`. Notice how each argument lives directly underneath `index_ctxt`.
 *
 * NOTE: Assumes that all parameter's of the inductive family are externally
 * quantified (i.e., above `index_ctxt`) and are thus effectively fixed.
 *
 * NOTE: Requires that the list of index arguments be used directly under the
 * local bindings (i.e., quantifiers) of `index_ctxt`, due to deBruijn indexing.

(*
 * Given an "arity" `typ` w.r.t. an inductive family over `nindex` indices,
 * substitute each bound index (i.e., `Rel i` for `i` s.t. `1 <= i <= nindex`)
 * with its eta-expansion w.r.t. the sigma type `sigT`, if applicable.
 *
 * The `nindex` quantifiers, which prefix the arity `typ`, are opened for the
 * above substitution and then closed in the result.
 *
 * NOTE: An "arity", in the context of inductive families, is a type quantifying
 * all an inductive family's indices (in order), followed by some codomain type.
 * For example, `forall (n : nat), Type` is an arity w.r.t. `vector`.

(*
 * Given the underlying eliminator's motive type, construct the motive term for
 * the wrapped eliminator to apply to that same underlying eliminator.
 *
 * This motive term is an eta expansion of that quantified, except that each
 * index to the inductive family is eliminated via `sigT_rect`, if applicable.
 *
 * By wrapping the quantified motive in this way, the user may (ultimately)
 * supply, to the wrapped eliminator, a motive term that relies on eta expansion
 * for sigma types.
 *
 * NOTE: Assumes that the result term lives underneath the wrapped eliminator's
 * full series of quantifiers (i.e., parameters, then motive, then indices).

(*
 * Construct a wrapper term around an inductive family's (given as a
 * `mind_specif`) eliminator (given as a constant `constr` reference with its
 * `types`), returning both the wrapper `constr` and its "natural" `types`.
 *
 * The wrapper term resembles an eta-expansion of the underlying eliminator,
 * except that the applied motive is also an eta-expansion in which any index
 * of sigma type is definitionally eta-expanded. The net effect is that the
 * wrapped eliminator accepts a motive expecting definitional eta-expansion
 * of indices with sigma type.
 *
 * The wrapped eliminator can be understood as enabling implicit dependent
 * elimination for the inductive family w.r.t. its indices of sigma type.
 * Since the canonical form of a sigma type is irrefutable, this (fairly)
 * simple instance of dependent elimination does not need to rely on any
 * extra axiom or any special (proof of a) property like UIP.
 *
 * NOTE: Using the returned `types` is not strictly necessary, but it is much
 * more readable than that inferred by type-checking.
