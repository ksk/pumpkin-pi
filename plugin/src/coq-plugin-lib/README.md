This is a library of useful utility functions for Coq plugins. These functions originally come from [PUMPKIN PATCH](https://github.com/uwplse/PUMPKIN-PATCH) and [DEVOID](https://github.com/uwplse/ornamental-search), but may be useful for plugin development more broadly.

To build this library with a test plugin, run:

```
./build.sh
```

See [PUMPKIN PATCH](https://github.com/uwplse/PUMPKIN-PATCH) and [DEVOID](https://github.com/uwplse/ornamental-search) for examples of loading it as a submodule.
